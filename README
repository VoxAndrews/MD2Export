MD2Export

Plugin for Autodesk Maya to export Quake MD2 Files

------------------------------------------------------------
How to Build:
------------------------------------------------------------

Right now, I'm only including the source, so you'll have to build the plugin
yourself using Visual Studio or via gcc on the command line. Later on,
I'll build this plugin against all the versions of the Maya API that I have,
so that you won't have to build this yourself if you'd rather just install
the plugin.

I've been building this project in Visual Studio 2008, so here
is how I got it to build:
 
1. Open the project properties window (Projects Menu > Project Properties) 

Under the C/C++ tab, make sure that you add a directory path to 
"Additional Include Directories" that points to the Maya API include 
files located in your Maya Install directory-- e.g. 
C:\Program Files\Autodesk\Maya2009\include

Under the Linker tab, add a directory path to "Additional Libraries"
for the lib directory in your Maya install 
(e.g. C:\Program Files\Autodesk\Maya2009\lib)


2. If your copy of Maya is 64 bit (as is mine), you'll need to go to the Active Configuration
menu in the toolbar (usually a dropdown menu with "Win32" selected). In that
dropdown menu, select "Edit", and in the window that appears create a duplicate 
configuration, and select "x64" for the target architecture in the dropdown menu
on the right.

3. Select "Build Solution" from the build menu. You'll get some compiler warnings,
but as long as it says "successful" at the end, you're good to go.

How to Install in Maya
------------------------------------------------------------
The .mll plugin itself that is generated in the Debug/Release
directory needs to go into the /<Maya install location>/bin/plug-ins
directory (e.g. C:\Program Files\Autodesk\Maya2009\bin\plug-ins).
Alternatively, you can load the plugin in Maya by going to Window > 
Settings/Prefs > Plug-in manager and click "Browse" and select the 
.mll that way

The export script (MD2ExportOptionsScript.mel) needs to go into
your "scripts" directory (e.g. C:\Users\you\My Documents\maya\scripts)
